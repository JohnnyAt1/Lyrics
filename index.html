        <h1>All of Me</h1>
        <h2> by John Legend</h2>
        <p> [Verse 1]</p>
        <p> What would I do without your smart mouth? <br>
            Drawing me in, and you kicking me out<br>
            You've got my head spinning, no kidding<br>
            I can't pin you down<br>
            What's going on in that beautiful mind?<br>
            I'm on your magical mystery ride<br>
            And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me<br>
            But I'll be alright
            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>
                My head's underwater<br>
                But I'm breathing fine<br>
                You're crazy and I'm out of my mind<br>
                <p> [Chorus] </p>
                'Cause all of me loves all of you<br>
                Love your curves and all your edges<br>
                All your perfect imperfections<br>
                Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you<br>
                You're my end and my beginning<br>
                Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
                <p> [Post-Chorus]</p>
                'Cause I give you all of me<br>
                And you give me all of you, oh-oh<br>

                <p> Verse 2</p>
                <p>
                    How many times do I have to tell you<br>
                    Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?<br>
                    The world is beating you down<br>
                    I'm around through every mood<br>
                    You're my downfall, you're my muse<br>
                    My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues<br>
                    I can't stop singing<br>
                    It's ringing in my head for you<br>
                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
                    <p> 
                        My head's underwater<br>
                        But I'm breathing fine<br>
                        You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind<br>
                        'Cause all of me loves all of you<br>
                        Love your curves and all your edges<br>
                        All your perfect imperfections<br>
                        Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you<br>
                        You're my end and my beginning<br>
                        Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
                        'Cause I give you all of me<br>
                        And you give me all of you, oh-oh<br>
                        Give me all of you<br>
                        Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts<br>
                        Risking it all, though it's hard<br>
                        'Cause all of me loves all of you<br>
                        Love your curves and all your edges<br>
                        All your perfect imperfections<br>
                        Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you<br>
                        You're my end and my beginning<br>
                        Even when I lose, I'm winning<br>
                        'Cause I give you all of me<br>
                        And you give me all of you<br>
                        I give you all of me<br>
                        And you give me all of you, oh-oh<br>
